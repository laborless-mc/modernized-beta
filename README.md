### **Installation:**
Make a new b1.7.3 installation in MultiMC.
Add the latest release to the .jar in MultiMC.

### **What is this?**
The goal with modernized beta is to make b1.7.3 competitive with modern minecraft, while maintaining the charm that modern minecraft has lost.

I will try to add as much content as possible without making the game feel bloated how many overhaul mods do.
